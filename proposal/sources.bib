	abstract = {Backtesting represents a set of techniques that aim to evaluate trading strategies on historical data in order to verify their effectiveness before applying them to a market in real time. This requires processing large amounts of data from different periods and applying different simulation techniques to them. In general, these types of tools are not very popular for reasons such as the amount of data that must be evaluated and maintained, the computational resources that are required, and the need to have a deep conceptual understanding of these techniques in order to use them. This article presents a web application that implements a set of backtesting functionalities that allow evaluating different trading strategies, managing portfolios, representing the results of simulations, and optimizing a stock portfolio, all from an intuitive and visual interface that makes these techniques accessible to new investors in this field.},

	abstract = {Algorithmic trading is a method of executing orders using automated pre-programmed trading instructions accounting for variables such as time, price, and volume. This type of trading attempts to leverage the speed and computational resources of computers relative to human traders. In the twenty-first century, algorithmic trading has been gaining traction with both retail and institutional traders. A study in 2019 showed that around 92\% of trading in the Forex market was performed by trading algorithms rather than humans. 
It is widely used by investment banks, pension funds, mutual funds, and hedge funds that may need to spread out the execution of a larger order or perform trades too fast for human traders to react to. However, it is also available to private traders using simple retail tools. Algorithmic trading is widely used in equities, futures, crypto and foreign exchange markets.
The term algorithmic trading is often used synonymously with automated trading system. These encompass a variety of trading strategies, some of which are based on formulas and results from mathematical finance, and often rely on specialized software.
Examples of strategies used in algorithmic trading include systematic trading, market making, inter-market spreading, arbitrage, or pure speculation, such as trend following. Many fall into the category of high-frequency trading ({HFT}), which is characterized by high turnover and high order-to-trade ratios. {HFT} strategies utilize computers that make elaborate decisions to initiate orders based on information that is received electronically, before human traders are capable of processing the information they observe. As a result, in February 2013, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ({CFTC}) formed a special working group that included academics and industry experts to advise the {CFTC} on how best to define {HFT}.  Algorithmic trading and {HFT} have resulted in a dramatic change of the market microstructure and in the complexity and uncertainty of the market macrodynamic, particularly in the way liquidity is provided.},

	abstract = {Algorithms have been used in finance since the early 2000s and accounted for 25\% of the market around 2005. In this research, algorithms account for approximately 85\% of the market. The challenge faced by many investors and fund managers is beating the Swedish market index {OMXS}30. This research investigates publicly available algorithms and their potential for implementation and modification to outperform the market. There is a lot of research done on the subject and most of the research found was mostly at a high academic level. Although few algorithms were found in the search, some algorithms that managed to beat other markets caught interest. The market data for this research was obtained from Nordnets closed {API}, specifically the historical price data of various financial securities. The algorithms use the historical price data to generate buy and sell signals which represents a trade. These trades were then used to calculate performance metrics such as the geometric mean and the sharpe ratio. The performance metrics are used to measure and compare performance with the {OMXS}30 using a quantitative method. On average, the algorithms did not perform well on the chosen securities, although some securities stood out in all cases. Beating the market is considered a difficult task, and this research reflects some of the challenges involved. The chosen method highlights the importance of the stocks the algorithms trade, emphasizing that stocks cannot be chosen randomly. Building a fully automated unsupervised trading system is challenging and requires extensive work. Some strategies tend to require human supervision to maximize returns and limit losses, while others yield low returns for low risk.},
